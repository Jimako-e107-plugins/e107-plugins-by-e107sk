### Forum plugin from version 1.0.4

Updated and fixed for e107 2.2 and PHP 7

This plugin is used for backup (archive) of old forums from version 1 to avoid update process and have fresh start with new version.

Don't use it as active forum plugin. 

If you dislike "clanforum" folder name, change it and fix defines and setup files.
